Js is a single-threaded language ->

JS executes teh code line by line & can execute one task at a time\

Multi threaded languages: C++, Java


JS is asynchronous

Mutability:
    Mutable: changing (references)
    Immutable: not changing (primitives)

Shallow copy: when you use the spread operator to create a copy of a JS object (reference type)
        - does NOT work with NESTED objects

Deep copy: use JSON parse and stringfy methods to create a copy of a JS objects
        - this will create an independent copy which will not affect the original object



JSON does not support - undefined, functions
