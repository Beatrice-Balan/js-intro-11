for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // Code to execute repeatedly
}

for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    console.log('Hello'); // Logs 0, 1, 2
}

Initialization:

This is where you define and set up a variable for the loop.
It runs only once at the start of the loop.
Example: let i = 0; (starts the counter at 0).
Condition:

A logical statement that is checked before each loop iteration.
If true, the loop runs. If false, the loop stops.
Example: i < 5; (runs while i is less than 5).
Update:

A statement to update the variable after each iteration.
Usually increments (i++) or decrements (i--) the counter.
Example: i++ (adds 1 to i after each loop).
Code Block:

The code inside the curly braces {} runs for each loop iteration.
