Array: is a built in object in JS to store multiple data- has properties and methods

Array() -> array constructor

Constructor: special method used to instantiate its blueprint/ prototype

Array.isArray() = static method because it belongs to the whole blueprint


const newArr = new Array()
arr.slice() - invoke this method bvecause you invoke with the Instance(above) of the array






Example - instance vs static -

class Mercedes {
    brand = "Mercedes"; // static info because it's static to all Mercedes, it's the brand
    color = "Black";  // instance property
}

const car1 = new Mercedes();
const car2 = new Mercedes();
car1.color = "Black"
car2.color = "White"

- these are instance properties
