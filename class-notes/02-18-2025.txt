GIT: software used to track files/ versions and collaborate with others

GitHub: Hosting website for repositories
Alternative: Bitbucket, Gitlab, Azure Dev0op

Git is distributed VCS (version control system)
    distributed vs centralized (no longer used)

we worked with 2 flows:
- local master branch -> made changes -> stage/ commit/ push -> remote master

LOCAL: your machine (laptop/ PC)
REMOTE: cloud

- local master branch -> copy to local task branch -> made changes -> stage/ commit/ push ->
    -> to remote task branch -> pull request (= merge request, people just say PR or MR) -> 
    -> Rewiewers will Approve -> goes to remote master


    CLONING REMOTE REPOSITORIES TO LOCAL
    1. You will be provided with repository url
    2. Copy the cloning address
    3. Open Terminal/ cmd and run below code in the correct path
        git clone <repository url>

MERGE CONFLICTS:
- when 2 or more collaborators work on the same file


Option #1: Resolve in line in GitHub

Option #2: Resolve in VS Code:

    1. Go to VS Code and switch to master (checkout master)
    Pull the changes into local master from remote master (git pull)
    Switch back to your local branch which caused CONFLICT
    Merge local master into your local branch (git merge master -> while youre on your branch)

You should see same conflicts in VS code
resolve and commit your changes one more time

- go back to VS code and see that everything is resolved
