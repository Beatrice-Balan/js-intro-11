ES6 - ES2015

Before ES6, JS was commonly used used for web development (frontend)

Frontend: UI (User Interface) of the application -> developed with JS
API: Application Programming Interface(REST, SOAP, GRAPHQL)
Backend: server & database

Backend devs use: Java, .NET/C#, Ruby, GO, JS (after ES6)

AFTER ES6: JS can now be used for backend development as well

INTERVIEW QUESTIONS:

Tell me some new features added with ES6 (100%)
 - let-const
 - for...of loop
 - arrow functions
 - string templates/ interpolation
 - spread operator
 - default parameters
 - rest parameters
 - classes
 - promises (async - await)
 - Map, Set

 Can you tell me in how many ways you can create functions in JS?
 1. function declaration
 2. function expression
 3. arrow function
 4. constructor function
 5. IIFE
 6. Recursive functions :
    - a function that invokes itself:

// there's an infinite loop for the below that creates stack overflow
    function printHi() {
        printHi();
    }

    printHi();

7. What is the difference between spread operator and rest parameters?

const arr = [1, 3, 4]
    - here ...arr -> will spread the array elements into individual values
The spread operator is used to expand or unpack elements of an array or object into individual elements.


function funcName(...rest) {

}
    - here ...rest will collect individual elements into an array

The rest operator is used to collect or gather a variable number of arguments into an array. 
It is typically used in function definitions to capture remaining parameters.
