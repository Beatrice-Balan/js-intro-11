Object.create() static method creates a new object, 
    using an existing object as the prototype of the newly created object.

Object.freeze() static method freezes an object. 
Freezing an object prevents extensions and makes existing properties non-writable 
and non-configurable. 

A frozen object can no longer be changed: new properties cannot be added, 
existing properties cannot be removed, their enumerability, configurability, writability, or value cannot be changed, 
and the object's prototype cannot be re-assigned. 

freeze() returns the same object that was passed in.
