+ operator is used for:
concatenation (strings next to eachother)
addition

string + number = string
'5' + 5 = 55

NaN: let price = '2149.99' / 2; // output: NaN

to convert into a number: 
let parseFloat('2149.99') / 2; // output will be ok, a number
let number('2149.99') / 2; // output will be ok, a number


BigInt

THRUTY and FALSY


INTERVIEW QUESTION
- difference between undefined and null

Undefined = for variables that are declared but not assigned with a value YET - there will be a value at some point

Null - is used to intentionally point out the ABSENCE OF DATA -> on purpose


SYMBOLS - ES6 feature


Statically typed languages - compiled languages (TS, Java, C#)


ARRAY INDEX:

first item -> [0]
second item -> [1]

last -> arrayName[arrayName.length -1]
second from the last -> arrayName[arrayName.length -2]

How to create an ARRAY?
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
const arr = new Array(1, 2, 3);

const arr = ['A', 'B', 'C'];

Arrays can be mixed with any data type, string, number, undefined, boolien (like 3 === 0), object. Anything, but not the norm

leetcode -> practice, preferred


RECAP

1. Primitives
 string: used to store text data (single or double quotes)
 number: used to store decimal and whole numbers, up to 64 bits
 boolean: used to store true/ false expressions (to evaluate true/ false statements)
 undefined: default data type for variables declared but not assigned with a value
 null: used to point the intentional absence of value
 BigInt: used to store decimal and whole numbers, up to AND ABOVE 64 bits
 symbol: 

 2. Reference Types (Objects)
- they're calld reference types. Stack (stores variables) & Heap (stores arrays, objects etc). 

  array: used to store multiple similar data (usually the data is similar but it can vary, string number, boolien etc)

  object: used to store key value pairs (properties) for ONE entity/ variable
const obj1 = {
    fname: 'John',
    lname: 'Doe',
    age: 25
};
const creditCardInfo = {
    fullName: 'John Doe'
    number: '123-123-123-1234', // string
    expirationDate: '04/27', // string
    securityCode: 123
};

creditCardInfo.number // pull up the card number '123-123-123-1234'
creditCardInfo.expirationDate = '04/33';  // used to update
creditcardInfo.bankName = 'Chase'; // used to ad new variables, data or information
