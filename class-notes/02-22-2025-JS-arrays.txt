DATA TYPES
- Primitives: 
    string: usd to store text data (quotes)
    number: used to store numbers including decimals
    boolean:  used to store true or false
    undefined: it is a variable declared but not assigned with value
    null: it is a variable declared and intentionally assigned with null, stating absence of data
    BigInt: used to store larger (more than 64 bit)
    Symbol: used to store a Symbol

- Reference Types:
    Arrays: are used to store multiple similar types of data
    Objects: are used to store key value pairs (properties)
    Functions: are also objects

ARRAYS:

*** constructor -> meaning in all prog languages
- used to instantiate an object from a blueprint/ template/ prototype

Example: const arr = new Array(); in this case -> 
- arr is the instance of the Array prototype
- Array is the blueprint/ prototype
- Array() is the constructor of the Array prototype
We use constructors with 'new' keyword -> helps create a new instance


*** INTERVIEW QUESTION YOU WILL GET FOR SURE ***
STRING: immutable -> original value canNOT be changed
Arrays: mutable -> original value can be changed

Primitives are immutable
References are mutable


unshift: add element to teh head of the array -> array becomes longer
shift: removes elements from the head of the arary -> shorter array
