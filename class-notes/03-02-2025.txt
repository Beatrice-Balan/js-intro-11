Loops:

1. for loop (traditional loop, first loop that was introduced): 
    - if you need indexes of something, helpful

2. while loop
3. do while loop
    - we use these if we don't know how many times our loop will iterate

4. for...of loop (otehr languages call it "for each loop") ES6
    - mostly used with arrays, strings, objects

5. for...in loop
    - uused with objects only


for...of loop: used to iteratethrough iterable objects (arrays mostly, but objects too)

- Maps, Sets - introduced in JS in 2015, not really used, because Arrays are powerful


WHEN TO USE for loop VS  for...of loop TO ITERATE ARRAYS/ OBJECTS

- for.. of loop, starts from index 0, because it has no control over indexes
- can't modify the start point, always from the beginning till the end
-

Will learn otehr methods that loop through array elements

forEach(), map(), filter(), reduce(), some(), every()
