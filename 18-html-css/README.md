# HTML - CSS

- HTML is the skeleton/ backbone of any web page/ app
- DOCTYPE - tells browser which version of html to render/ show (Most recent is v5)
- `html` is the most important part of the document
- what is a tag? `html` element - `<html></html>`. Element consists of tags
    - A tag in HTML is a keyword or label enclosed in angle brackets (< >) that defines elements in a web page's structure. Tags usually come in pairs, like `<p>` and `</p>`, to indicate the start and end of an element. Some tags, like `<img>`, are self-closing.

- `head` - Everything that is not visible to user

- `meta` - A `<meta>` tag in HTML provides metadata about the webpage, such as description, keywords, author, and character encoding. It helps with SEO, browser settings, and improving user experience. For example, it can specify the character set or viewport settings for responsive design.

`<meta charset="UTF-8">`
This tag specifies the character encoding for the document, ensuring that special characters (like accents or symbols) are displayed correctly. Thereâ€™s no need to close the <meta> tag, as it is self-closing.

- `body` - Everything that is visible to users
    -`headings` - text elements with tags from h1 to h6
    -`p` - paragraphs
    - `strong` - bold text
    - `em` - italic text
    - `hr` - horizontal line
    - `br` - break
    -`div` -  block-level element used to group content and structure a webpage. It's often used as a container for other elements, allowing you to apply CSS styles or JavaScript functions to a specific section of the page.
        - It has no inherent styling or meaning; it simply groups content.
        - It's often used in conjunction with CSS for layout purposes.
        - It's a versatile tag that can be used for creating sections, columns, or wrappers in a webpage.

    - *** Semantic Elements ***


** Nesting: Render element inside anotehr element


## Styling
1. inline Styling: apply CSS styles right inside the element itself (in that braket)
    -fastest one
    - it can get ugly/ crowded
    - ideally you want to separate your html and css logic, it can get harder to read, maintain and change
    - overrides internal styling

2. internal styling: Styles are inside the head section
- CSS specificity: inline stiling > internal styling

##Element atributes:
- `img` - href, alt, width, height
- `a` - href, target

- `id`: unique identifier
- `class` - common class selector
